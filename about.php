        <h2>About Manage Log</h2>
        <p>Manage Log was started in 2014 by an Environmental Services Manager looking for an alternative to paper and pencil documentation.  It was quickly determined that service information should be documented for quick retrieval, as opposed to shifting through endless papers and organizers.</p>
        <p>The solution was simple - develop a customizable toolkit that can be used in any type of service industry to monitor and track routine tasks.  After multiple months of running in a local facility, the toolkit was revamped and ready to assist other managers in the service industry.</p>
        <p>Understanding the service industry and environment has led to the features including in this toolkit.  There are many more enhanced features coming in the near future.</p>
