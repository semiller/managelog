        <h3>Membership</h3>

        <h3>Service Toolkit - Operation</h3>
        
        <p><strong>How do I get started?</strong></p>
        <p>As the registered member/manager, you are the set admin for the account/facility name you create.  This gives you the ability to create an unlimited number of departments and managers for your location.  The first step in setting up your account is to create departments, followed by management staff for those departments.</p>
        
        <p><strong>How do I grant access to my management staff?</strong></p>
        <p>Once you create new managers for your departments, they will be notified via email that you have created login credentials for them to start using our service.  The email will contain the username and password required for management login.  Once logged in, managers can view their profile page and change their password.</p>
        
        <p><strong>What are the benefits of the Admin account?</strong></p>
        <p>As the Admin member, you have full access to view content from all of the departments and managers.  You have the access to create, edit, and delete content from all departments.  The Admin account can also create global categories that all departments will have the benefit of using.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Why am I getting a warning message?</strong></p>
        <p>The warning messages are designed to inform you that categories must first be created before continuing with the adding of content.  Once categories are in place, the warning messages will no longer appear.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Can the management staff see each other manager's content?</strong></p>
        <p>No.  Each manager only has the ability to view their own content.  If a manager creates assistant managers to run the operation with them, they will only be able to view content related to their respective departments.</p>
